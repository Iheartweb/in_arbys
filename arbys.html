<h1>Thinking Arby's? We are too!</h1>

<p><strong>Taking someone to a place they haven't been to</strong> has been a LinkedIn UED tradition since it's infancy. While now we employe the Wheel of Lunch'In to determine the welcome lunch, there was an era where every Monday was a trip to the local Arby's. It holds a special place in our heart, and we want to share that special place with you.</p>

<p><strong>Our local Arby's is the one on South Bernardo,</strong> where you can eat your curly fries beneath the atrium or sip a Jamocha shake in the comfortable booths. Beef and cheddar never tasted so good!</p>
